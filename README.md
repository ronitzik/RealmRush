Welcome to the Realm Rush, a strategy-based game where players must defend their base from waves of enemies by placing towers strategically on a grid. 
The goal is to prevent enemies from reaching the end of the path by eliminating them with defensive towers.

## Game Overview
This game challenges players to manage resources, place towers on a grid-based map, and stop incoming enemies from reaching their destination.
